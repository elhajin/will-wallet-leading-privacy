###  WillWallet aims to ensure the security of users' crypto assets while providing practical and flexible solutions to enhance user experience.

## Inheritance Function
* The inheritance feature allows users to pass on their crypto assets to beneficiaries in case they become inactive for a certain period.
When the countdown exceeds beneficiaries can claim their shares. 

## Spending Limit Function (ToDo)
* This feature has significant benefits, such as minimizing potential loses when hunting for airdrops or avoiding scams. Users can adjust the spending limit, increase or decrease its amount, or remove it entirely through the wallet interface.
